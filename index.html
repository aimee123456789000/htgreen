            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and super-efficient
            heat pump and you're still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green Work with you to design and
            install a stystem that uses solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and into the
            future.

            <h2>Geothermal</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than 
                the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution 
                to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy year-round.
            <br>
            <br>
                Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but 
                has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate 
                boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the 
                range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as 
                home heating.
            <br>
            <br>
                Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the 
                earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels. 
                As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming 
                if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.

            <h2>Wind Turbines</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a 
                wind turbine system that generates electricity when the wind blows. Team a 
                wind turbine with a solar PV system and you increase your energy generation 
                potential.
            <br>
            <br>
                New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind turbine 
                works, the benefits of wind energy and how a wind turbine is installed.<br><br> 
                If you're not sure on the type of turbine you need, before you buy from us, 
                contact one of our wind power experts for the right advice.
